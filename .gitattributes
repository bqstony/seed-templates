# Set the default behavior, if Git thinks a file is text (as opposed to binary), 
# also in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout. E.g.,
#*.c text

# Declare files that will always have LF line endings on checkout.
